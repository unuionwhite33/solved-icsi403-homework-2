 <li>Given below are several pairs of functions f(n) and g(n). For each pair, . Show work. For some of these, you may need to use L’Hospital’s rule.</li>

</ol>




<ul>

 <li>f(n) = 15n<sup>2</sup> and g(n) = 5. (b) f(n) = 2<sup>n</sup> and g(n) = n<sup>2</sup>.</li>

</ul>

(c) f(n) = n ln n and g(n) = 17n<sup>2</sup> + 4. (Note that “ln” denotes the natural logarithm.) (d) f(n) = 3<sup>n</sup> and g(n) = 2<sup>n</sup>.




<ol start="2">

 <li>(a) Use induction on n to prove that for all integers n &gt;= 0, the value 4<sup>n</sup> + 1 is not divisible by 3.</li>

</ol>




<ul>

 <li>Consider the infinite sequence of integers f<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, …, defined by f<sub>0</sub> = 1, f<sub>1</sub> = 2 and</li>

</ul>

f<sub>n</sub> = f<sub>n-1</sub> + f<sub>n-2</sub> for all n &gt;= 2. Use <em>induction on n</em> to prove that for all n &gt;= 1.




<ol start="3">

 <li>Let A = {x; y; z; w} and let B = {1; 2; 3}. Determine the number of functions from A to B that are neither one-to-one nor map y to 3. Show work. (20 points) <strong>Hint:</strong> Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.</li>

</ol>







<ol start="4">

 <li>Let A = {x<sub>1</sub>; x<sub>2</sub>; …; x<sub>10</sub>} be a set of 10 positive integers, not necessarily distinct, such that x<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 10. Prove that there are at least two different 5-element subsets S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2 </sub>of A such that the sum of the elements in S<sub>1</sub> is equal to the sum of the elements in S<sub>2</sub>.</li>
